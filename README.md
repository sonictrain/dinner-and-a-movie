## About the Project

### Project Description

Our task for this project was to use everything weâ€™ve learned over the course of this bootcamp to create a real-world front-end web application that we will be able to showcase to potential employers.

To that end, we have created a responsive interactive webpage that generates suggestions for movies and accompanying food recipes in response to the user input.

### Project Goal

In addition to practicing the skills we have acquired during this bootcamp, another main goal of this project was to experience working on a project as a team, deciding the best way to assign tasks and learning how to work across multiple branches in GitHub.

### Project Features

* Responsive web app that generates suggestions for a movie and accompanying meal

* Use of two server-side APIs (TMDB API and Edamam API)
 
* Dynamically coded cards to display results

* User is able to enter keyword in search box

* Search results returned based on user input
 
* User is able to save items in favourite list using local storage

* Saved items persist between page refreshes
